###Understanding _Tribler_

Before starting this report, it's necessary to understand that the concepts learnt in the context of the subject of Software Engineering don't fully apply to an open-source project like _Tribler_, since they're adapted to proprietary software projects.

Having said that, after analysing the existing documentation of this project, we were not able to find any information whatsoever regarding the requirements management process. That way, this report will be mostly based on assumptions and the little information we could deduct.

###Requirements elicitation

In requirements engineering, requirements elicitation is the practice of collecting the requirements of a system from users, customers and other stakeholders. Before requirements can be analyzed, modeled, or specified they must be gathered through an elicitation process.

There is no clear definition of the requirements, only an objective: making Bittorrent anonymous and impossible to shut down, giving anonymous access to online (streaming) videos and trying to make privacy, strong cryptography and authentication the Internet norm.

###Requirements specification

A software requirements specification (SRS) is a description of a software system to be developed, laying out functional and non-functional requirements, and may include a set of use cases that describe interactions the users will have with the software. This document permits a rigorous assessment of requirements before design can begin and reduces later redesign. It should also provide a realistic basis for estimating product costs, risks, and schedules.

As far as we know, _Tribler_ doesn't use a SRS.

###Analysis and validation

Validation is the process of confirming the completeness and correctness of requirements. Validation is essential to identification of missing requirements and to ensure that the requirements meet certain quality characteristics.

The main source of requirements are the lists of issues and pull requests existent on GitHub. Any collaborator can report bugs and suggest new features and enhancements. Every pull request is verified by an administrator that thoroughly analyses it, trying to clearly understand what it adds/changes in the project. The [buildbot Jenkins](http://jenkins.tribler.org/) is used for the tests: if the new build passes all the tests, the pull request is accepted.

###Critical analysis

The development of _Tribler_ started in 2005 and has been Internet deployed for 8 years now. Roughly 10 to 15 scientists and engineers work full-time on it. However, there is little official support. This project doesn't seem to follow the guidelines open-source projects usually do. From what we could gather, "outside" developers are only able to interact through GitHub, but the active community is not very big. The [official forum](http://forum.tribler.org/) is only used by users to report bugs and by the core team to announce new versions.
